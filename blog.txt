Installed distribution Xtion Pro CD and could run sample applications under PrimeSense but cannot figure how to compile examples either here or under OpenCV yet.

Installed Fubi from https://www.informatik.uni-augsburg.de/lehrstuehle/hcm/projects/tools/fubi/

Copied whole directory to E:\Documents\visual studio 2010\projects\Xtion
and after opening FUBI.sln, edited FubiConfig.h to comment out #define FUBI_USE_OPENCV
and then the application would compile but not tracking data.

During installation it did say that some things were missing.
So I did download a different version of OpenNi (SimpleOpenNI-1.96) which may be a precurser to version 2.

Shall try to install openCV now V2.4.10 from http://opencv.org/downloads.html  = 358MB download
and saved it in e:/documents/xtion
When unpacked, I relocated it to e:/libaries.  (couldn't use "program files" as the space in a name seemed to cause difficulties.
The readme.md recommanded the tutorials:
http://docs.opencv.org/doc/tutorials/tutorials.html
which point to ->
http://docs.opencv.org/doc/tutorials/introduction/windows_install/windows_install.html#windows-installation
which point to ->
http://docs.opencv.org/doc/tutorials/introduction/windows_install/windows_install.html#windowssetpathandenviromentvariable

so from command prompt as administrator I have set:

setx -m OPENCV_DIR "E:\Libraries\opencv\build\x86\vc10"

which responded:

SUCCESS: Specified value was saved.

setx PATH "PATH;%OPENCV_DIR%\bin"

Same response. Now appears in the path variable.

I tried adding the include $(OPENCV_DIR)\..\..\include to "Additional Include Directories" but that didn't seem to work, so I added to the VC++ directories and that seemed to work but evidently it is a global solution for all vc projects.

Now certain dll s are missing.  All attempts to add the path to the dll's in failed.

Even http://www.informatik.uni-augsburg.de/de/lehrstuehle/hcm/projects/tools/fubi/doc/install.html  has no firm advice.

I notice that a lot of the 2011 dlls are in the projects directory, so, in desperation, I have copied the dll file across and now it works.  Both examples now compile and run with skeleton tracking.

Moving on to fubi doc tutorial1, the init() functon is in Fubi.cs and is called in the startNextSensor() function of the main.cs file for the Recognizer test.


When moving the sensor, this error occured:
An exception of type 'System.InvalidOperationException' occurred in System.Core.dll but was not handled in user code

Additional information: Sequence contains no elements

at line #217 or RecognizerStatsWindow.xaml.cs =
                    color = colorLookup[col.ToArgb()].First().Name;
for color = FF007FFF


For our Peacock spider dance application we need to record and playback a sillotte of a human dancing.

Fubi.getImage() (in MainWindow.xaml.cs seems to grab data to s_buffer which could be recorded - possibly with some compression for non-movement as detected by the skeleton tracking.

wb.WritePixels() is the point at which it can be injected back into the display.

Have added simple record to file and playbackbut intend to turn temporary file into compressed avi file.

test.xml dated 13/01/2015 has something that can cause a fatal error in the code - rarely the same error each time.


Installed git (firstly from GitHub but this gave no gui I could understand, then downloaded the dev version of msysgit by mistake
 - use the download fro the top of http://msysgit.github.io/ .  Create repository FubiQ, also at Github at RobertAtQuestacon.
 git config --global user.name "Robert Parker"
 git config --global user.email "robert.parker@questacon.edu.au"
 Used git add -A tp add all to repo and git commit -m "intial commit"
 git remote add origin https://github.com/RobertAtQuestacon
 git push -u origin master
 
 Add VisualStudio.gitignore from github repository before the push.

Trying RecognnizerTest, needed to disable incremental linking using solution in  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12267158/failure-during-conversion-to-coff-file-invalid-or-corrupt

Complains that I have forgotten to enable FUBI_OPEN_NI2 in config but when I do it cannot find Nite.h

https://www.informatik.uni-augsburg.de/lehrstuehle/hcm/projects/tools/fubi/doc/tutorial2.html has a speeling error for "BasicDirecton", "peace".  1,2,3 recognizers work fine.

For creation of AnimalDanceOff, I need to change the output directory to ..\bin\ in the BuildTab so that it could find the DLLs.
 (Orignally put as ..\..\bin as it looks like the project is in the Samples subdirectory when it isn't)

AnimalDanceOff working well with raw recorded video playing on left and live xtion feed on the right.
Wasted a day getting gz compression working but it is too slow.

System.Windows.Media.Imaging Namespace seemed like a good idea but the tffEncoder just copied the same frame over and over again.

The Aforge AVIWriter class looks promising (http://www.aforgenet.com/framework/docs/html/5fedbbbe-6d28-5f69-35a2-9d7119544a2d.htm) so I have downloaded the AForge.NET Framework-2.2.5 framework to E:\Documents\aforge.

Also found a Kinect Capture program in http://www.aforgenet.com/framework/samples/video.html but the sources are in C:\Program Files\AForge.NET\Framework\Samples\Video\Kinect Capture

The dlls for referencing can be found in C:\Program Files\AForge.NET\Framework\Release

Video recording as gz compressed frames working well in video class. Add trim to video.
Gestures working except it seems you cannot have combined gestures of combined gestures.
Also possibly two combined gestures cannot occur at the same time?
